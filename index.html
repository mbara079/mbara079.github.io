        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello to whom this may concern, my name is Mariana Barajas and I have made it my passion and goal to help people who struggle with behavioral, mental, learning disorders. Inclusion is a really big value of mine and everyone should feel comfortable expressing and being themselves in any environment. There are ways to help oneself when someone is struggling such as going to a psychologist/psychiatrist that have been biologically and mentally proven to improve such struggles. Given the facts and my own personal take on life, I want to help any individual who needs it, whether that is an extremely critical disorder or a person without any present disorders. Everybody needs help sometimes and it should be a normalized societal change. I would also like to point out that there are other moral changes that have yet to be experimented and challenged and I will try my hardest to research and change the ways that specific morals have been set, specifically living a balanced life. A balanced life involves physical and psychological processes which must be exercised to their fullest potential, but glorifying certain individuals who push themselves too hard is an issue. 
<br><br>

        Currently, I have been given the opportunity to work at an institute for behavioral health which is my first step into the listed goals of mine. I have also needed help and guidance in the past and many people have too , but have been scared to admit the longevity of their illness or the specifics of their illness/ disorder. If people are scared to ask for help, how will the worldâ€™s ambition, success, and total well-being change? Helping people is my mission and the way I proposed this idea was through volunteer work. Assisting people at senior living centers, food pantries, and regular events has made me realize everyone has a story and sharing it is needed for oneâ€™s health. Interacting with my peers, my church groups, and everyone I came in contact with in my life led me to a conclusion. I was meant to help people and interact with people. Everyone who is healthy can make a positive difference in any personâ€™s life. I want to dedicate myself to this mission and right now I believe that people are starting to shift their views on psychological processes.
<br><br>

        My future steps are to get my degree, go to medical school, obtain my residency , license and certification . I intend to keep working and continuing my degree at UCR. After I obtain my bachelorâ€™s degree I intend to start a medical program pertaining to my specialization in psychology. If I decide to become a clinical psychiatrist I will start my hands-on preparation at a hospital. I have also contemplated going into forensic psychiatry because that is also a value of mine, humanitarianism. Lastly, I will have to review my stateâ€™s stipulations for licensing and certification. Besides this I intend to have self efficacy throughout my career regarding updates on research and to refresh my knowledge too.
